OPERATORS GUIDE



ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

+
Addition (a+b)
This operation adds both the operands on either side of the + operator.
-
Subtraction (a-b)
This operation subtracts the right-hand operand from the left.
*
Multiplication (a*b)
This operation multiplies both the operands.
/
Division (a/b)
This operation divides the left-hand operand by the operand on the right.
%
Modulus (a%b)
This operation returns the remainder after dividing the left-hand operand by the right operand.


LOGICAL OPERATORS

&&
AND (a&&b)
This operator returns TRUE only if both the operands are TRUE or if both conditions are satisfied. It not, it returns FALSE.
||
OR (a||b)
This operator returns TRUE if either operand is TRUE. It also returns TRUE if both the operands are TRUE. If neither operand is true, it returns FALSE.
!
NOT (!a)
This unary operator returns TRUE if the operand is FALSE and vice versa. It is used to reverse the logical state of its (single) operand.


RELATIONAL OPERATORS

===
Exact Equals (a===a)
This operator checks if both sides are equal but also cares if types are same and equal.
==
Equal (a==b)
This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE.
!=
Not equal (a!=b)
This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If not, the condition becomes TRUE.
>
Greater than (a>b)
This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than the right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE.
<
Less than (a<b)
This operator checks if the left operand is less than the value of right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE.
>=
Greater than or equal (a>=b)
This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value.


VOCABULARY



Algorithm: a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. It's a computer's thought process.

Argument: is a way to provide more information to a function. The function can then use that information as it runs, like a variable (For more info on variables, see below.)

Arrays: are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the animals in cages are the variables inside. 

Arithmetic operators: are essential in almost every application, especially in games. If a game character earns experience, it needs to be added to the total earned. If an arrow hits an enemy, the damage the enemy takes needs to be calculated.

Assignment operators:  (+=, -=, *=, /=) are operators that combine variable assignments (=) with arithmetic operators. They serve as a shortcut when coders have to perform an operation that changes the value of a variable. If a rock falls on a game player's head, health needs to be subtracted from their total, and so on.

Binary numbers: a binary number is a computer's way to represent information. Computers process millions of 1's and 0's a minute using different rules to interpret them as numbers, letters, operators, and everything else put into a computer.

Bit:  individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits. 

Boolean: a result that can only have one of two possible values: true or false.

Computer Program: a group of instructions given to a computer to be processed.

Conditional Statement: tells a program to execute an action depending on whether a condition is true or false.

Control Flow: the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Data Type: refers to the type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied without causing an error.

Floating Point Number: a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point.

Function: a block of code that can be referenced by name to run the code it contains. 

Integers: numbers without a fractional component, and don't support decimal points.

Loop: a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.

Operator: a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process.

Pseudocode: informal way of programming that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations.

String: a sequence of characters and or symbols.

Syntax: rules that govern the structure of the symbols, words, and punctuation found in programming languages.

Variable: is a storage location and an associated symbolic name which contains some known or unknown quantity or information, a value.
