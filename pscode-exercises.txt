// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

10
multiple of 2
even number

15
not multiple of 2
not even number

check number
is number a valid multiple of 2
if yes, then even
if no, then odd
print yes/no response accordingly with result


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

intake data
separately section off numbers by 5 at a time
scan and store the maximum and minimum values out of the section of 5 numbers
add section together, find sum
divide sum by 5
display result of the average with an additional message to tell the user that "this is the average of the five numbers you entered"
display stored maximum and minimum values with an additional message to tell the user that "these are the largest and smallest numbers in the set you entered"
